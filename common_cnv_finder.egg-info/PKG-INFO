        Common CNV Finder is a Python tool that finds copy number variants (CNVs) shared by two individuals. It accepts CSV files containing CNVs detected in individual genomes, with columns ['Chrom', 'Start', 'Stop', 'Type', 'P_Value'].
        
        Common CNV Finder removes CNVs based on specific parameters, such as:
            1. User-defined minimum CNV length
            2. User-defined P-value threshold
            3. Inaccurate CNV calls located on 'chrM'
            
        And generates an output file containing the CNVs common to both samples based on additional criteria:
             1. CNV located on same chromosome
             2. CNV is of same type (Deletion or Duplication)
             3. CNV start sites are within a user-defined distance of each other (i.e. 25 bp)
             4. CNV stop sites are within a user-defined distance of each other
             
         The output file has the same format as the input and can be exported as a CSV to a specified path.
